# MicroBlocks

[MicroBlocks](https://microblocks.fun/) is an online, block-based
programming environment.

MicroBlocks programming uses stacks of blocks to build programs. Blocks in
a stack are executed from top to bottom and your program can have multiple
stacks in it, these will be evaluated asynchronously when the program
runs.

As of this writing, Gizmo support is only available in the MicroBlocks
pilot release. You can access the pilot editor at
<https://microblocks.fun/run-pilot/>.

The MicroBlocks wiki documents the editor and libraries. The
[User Guide](https://wiki.microblocks.fun/en/ide) and
[Block Reference](https://wiki.microblocks.fun/en/reference_manual) pages
are good resources to familiarize yourself with MicroBlocks.
