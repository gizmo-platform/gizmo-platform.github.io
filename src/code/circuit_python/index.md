# Circuit Python

[Circuit Python](https://docs.circuitpython.org/) is a dialect of the
Python programming language targetting microcontrollers. It is maintained
by [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com).

The programming experience with Circuit Python is based on writing and
copying Python source files to the device through your computer's file
system. This means you can write Circuit Python code in any text editor.
With that said, there is an ecosystem of recommended tools that make the
process even easier.

Documentation for the Circuit Python language and core libraries are
available at
<https://docs.circuitpython.org/>.

Adafruit provides excellent, beginner-focussed documentation on how to use
Circuit Python at
