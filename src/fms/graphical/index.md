# Graphical Workflow

The Graphical Workflow is the recommended method for all users
installing and operating the Gizmo FMS.  This workflow is primarily
web-based with a few text interfaces that are used for early system
configuration.

Prior to completeing tasks in this section, you should complete the
[Workstation Setup](../setup.md) tasks which involve installing the
software image on the FMS.
