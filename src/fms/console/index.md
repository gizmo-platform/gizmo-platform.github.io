# Console Setup Workflow

> [!WARNING]
>
> This is an advanced workflow that is not necessary for the vast,
> vast majority of users of the Gizmo platform.  The console setup
> workflow was the original setup workflow to build the FMS setup
> prior to the introduction of the web interface, and is no longer

The Console Setup workflow performs most setup tasks using textual
commands entered into a terminal window.  You can use any terminal you
like, even completing these steps remotely logged in via `ssh`.  The
Gizmo FMS workstation ships with a handful of terminal emulators
installed, which can be found in the applications menu.

Prior to completeing tasks in this section, you should complete the
[Workstation Setup](../setup.md) tasks which involve installing the
software image on the FMS.
